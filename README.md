a project in WordPress using the Rest Api

## New technologies used

Rest API, and utilising the browsers history object

## Personal learnings

I am becoming more acustomed to the _underscores starter theme(knowing what to delete and what to add right away). I also found I learned a bit about localizing scripts, which came in handy making the post data available to api.js. 

Something I'm happy with is I used the browser history state object to keep track of the small amount of post data I was using. This allowed the site to not reload or fetch any extra data when navigating with the back and forward buttons. I found it was fairly performant.



## To Do

- There is an annoying bug where occasionly the random post is the same as the one you are currently viewing, which makes the site feel unresponsive. I really want to fix this.
